  	<p>Many travelers are drawn to the City of Zherith.
Some have come to worship the tower and believe that it has the power to heal.
The people of the lands surrounding the tower have declared it sacred and it is
a crime punishable by death to desecrate it. When Wolfgrave and his trusty partner
Urgnot first arrived in town, he began asking people about the tower. The locals
spoke of warriors that come to conquer the tower, but while many have entered,
none have ever returned.</p>

<h3>History of the Tower</h3>
<p>Centuries ago there was a great war between the Elders of Magic that brought great
darkness and despair for nearly 200 years. As the Elders of Magic fought for power
over the lands, many died and entire civilizations were destroyed. In an effort to
save what was left, a small group of Elders decided to enchant an amulet to absorb
the power of the warring Elders. They believed that magic should be used for the
benefit of all mankind, so they created the endless tower and placed the guardians
to protect the amulet. Anyone who wished to harness this power could enter and face
the trials to prove themselves worthy. This ended the 200 year long war and peace
began to be return to the lands.</p>

<h3>The Guardians of the Tower</h3>
<p>Many guardians exist inside the tower. Legend states that the beasts grow
stronger each floor of the tower, but no one dares speak of the prophecy
of the Unendlicher Turm. The prophecy states an amulet was hidden amongst
the souls of the guardians, and that there is no real way to release it.
This frightens the magicians of the modern era, because the prophecy
continues to say that the secret magic will instead be discovered in the one
who can best the Final Guardian, Hurk. Thus the ancient magic has already
been granted to a chosen one - but are you that chosen one? </p>
