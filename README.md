# Game Design Assignment 1

### Setting up dev environment

If you're not familiar, this project uses Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

> Be sure to allow the extra features it asks for, like `npm`.

1. From your terminal / command prompt, run `npm install`
2. You can run `npm start` to start the server now
3. Open `127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser to see the game
> `localhost` will not work - it is important to use `127.0.0.1`
4. Any changes you make will auto-refresh the appropriate components on the page. Be aware this may refresh the entire page if you changed the JavaScript core to the game.
